hessiancpp Installation Instructions

1. Original environment

hessiancpp was developed on a Fedora Core 2 x86_64 system, using
* GCC 3.3.3
* OpenSSL 0.9.7a
* BOOST 1.31.0
* SSLPP as a shared library
* ZLIB 1.2.1.1 release 2.1
and ported to Windows XP and 2000 Server, using
* Microsoft C++ 13.10 (VS.NET 2003)
* OpenSSL 0.9.7d
* BOOST 1.31.0
* SSLPP as a static library
* ZLIB 1.2.1


2. Configure your environment

2.1 Supplied Makefile

The Makefile assumes that SSLPP is installed at /usr/local/sslpp/include|lib.
If it's not make sure it gets there, or edit the location in the Makefile.
The Makefile's default target builds a test program.

2.2 VS.NET project

You can create a VS.NET project for the source code found here. Make sure
you include SSLPP, BOOST, ZLIB.
We will probably provide a sample project at a later date.


3. If the above does not work

Then please fix it and give it back to us !
