hessiancpp
A Hessian C++ implementation

The hessiancpp library consists of:
- simple HTTP library with SSL support, SSLPP (included);
- implementation of the Hessian protocol;
- GZIP support both in the client and in the server (the hessian server side
code has a small, non-intrusive addition that compresses the output stream if
the size of the reply exceeds a certain value); we've found this to *greatly*
reduce the size of the messages for replies of type List<LargeBean> or exception
stack traces (that are mostly irrelevant for C++);
- a hessian_proxy class that can be used to dynamically invoke remote methods.

Please see the INSTALL file for installation info.
Please see main.cpp for example usage.
