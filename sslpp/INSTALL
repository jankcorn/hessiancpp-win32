SSLPP Installation Instructions

1. Original environment

SSLPP was developed on a Fedora Core 2 x86_64 system, using
* GCC 3.3.3
* OpenSSL 0.9.7a
* BOOST 1.31.0
* shared library
and ported to Windows XP and 2000 Server, using
* Microsoft C++ 13.10 (VS.NET 2003)
* OpenSSL 0.9.7d
* BOOST 1.31.0
* static library


2. Configure your environment

2.1 Supplied Makefile

The Makefile assumes that BOOST is in your default include PATH.
If it's not make sure it gets there.
The Makefile's default target builds a shared library.
The "install" target installs the headers and the shared library
in $(PREFIX)/include and $(PREFIX)/lib.
The "client" target depends on "install" and builds a simple test
program.
You may want to edit the PREFIX value.

2.2 Supplied VS.NET project

The VS.NET project:
- assumes the sslpp source code is found in ..\ssl++\
- builds the static library ssl++w.lib


3. If the above does not work

Then please fix it and give it back to us !
Things should not be complicated at all, after all we're talking
about a 10 source file library.

4. Good luck
