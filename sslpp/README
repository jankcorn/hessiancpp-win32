SSLPP is a C++ library for HTTP over plain and SSL connections.
It does minimal POST and response parsing.

It does not in any way try to match up with other libraries such
as CURL, but instead tries to provide a simple, clean, C++ API for
posting data to an URL and getting the reply back, either on
HTTP or HTTPS. It does not provide access to headers and whatnot,
although you could alter/extend the library to do so.
SSLPP is also a bit smaller than CURL compiled with optimisations
and stripped.

Please see LICENSE and ORIGINAL.COPYRIGHT for licensing info.
Please see the INSTALL file for installation info.

Included is a Doxygen file to generate class documentation; also
see the code in client.cpp.
